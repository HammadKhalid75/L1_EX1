# Kotlin: First 50 Primes + First 50 Even Numbers

A simple Kotlin program that:

1. **Finds the first 50 prime numbers** using an efficient `isPrime` check.
2. **Creates the first 50 even numbers** (2, 4, ..., 100).
3. **Combines both lists** and prints the result.

---

## Output
First 50 prime numbers:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 229]

Combined list (primes + evens):

[2, 3, 5, ..., 229, 2, 4, 6, ..., 100]
